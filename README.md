# Instructions for Toy Car Tutorial

## Mission (problem to solve w/ Story)
You have been hired by a children's aid society to put together a list of instructions that show a child how to build a toy car without using pre built pieces.
They want to see a prototype of the car and they want to make sure it will travel at least 2 meters after being rolled down a ramp.
Once your project is complete they will use your instructions to give to less fortunate children so they can build their own toy car and develop some engineering skills in the process.

## Technologies / Topics to Learn

* ** Mechanics of moving objects ** -
* ** Friction and aerodynamics ** -

## Designs

#### Task Overview

Design and build a toy car from spare everyday parts (nothing pre made). You must test it out and improve your design.
When you have a completed car, you need to write simple step-by-step instructions that a child can follow. It should fit onto 1 sheet of paper so it can be copied easily.
The car needs to travel 2m off the end of a ramp. It would also be nice if it looks cool at the end.

#### Empathy

* Think about less fortunate children and how your design can help them learn to create something from nothing.
* Think about what engineering skills this task could teach someone else.

#### Define

* ______Not sure what to put here_____

#### Ideate - try out several ideas

* Discuss how you might build 2 to 3 different versions of your car to think about which design may work best.
* Write clear step-by-step instructions on how to build your toy car, and try to follow them as if you were a child.

#### Prototype -- focused plan (choose a way forward)

* Sketch 2 to 3 versions of your toy car.
* Show your sketches to another group of students and explain how your car will work.
* Find our what part of each sketch is best liked by the other group - write notes on what they liked best

#### Prototype -- Smallify, Build and Test

* Adjust your design (take the best parts of each design)

#### Prototype Adjust until Accepted

* Show your finished toy car to the Childrens Aid Society when you are ready
* Show your instructions on how to build the car to the Childrens Aid Society when you are ready.
* Make adjustments as needed
* Your project will be documented on your website when accepted by the investors

## Technical Steps
 * To be created by you.
